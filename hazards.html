            <h2>What Are Nartual Hazards?</h2>
            <p>Natural hazards are any plant or animal that can be dangerous to humans, usually by being either poisonous or venomous. They are throught Southern Cakifornia and can come in all shapes and sizes. Some daangers are easy to spot, while others seem harmless to the unknowing eye.</p>

        <section id="hazard-plants" class="hazard-section">
            <h2>Common Hazardous Plants</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Poison Oak:</strong> Found in many natural plant communities, including forests, grassy hillsides, recreation areas, and along the coast. It's especially common below 5,000 ft (1,500 m), especially west of the Sierras and the Mojave Desert.</li>
                <li><strong>Purple Nightshade:</strong> Purple nightshade is a California native perennial herb that can grow up to four feet tall and wide. It has clusters of showy purple flowers that bloom in the winter and spring.</li>
                <li><strong>Castor Bean:</strong> Castor bean is highly toxic and contains ricin, a chemical that can kill an adult if they consume four to eight seeds. Handling the seeds and foliage can also cause severe dermatitis.</li>
                <li><strong>The Death Cap:</strong> The Death Cap is the deadliest of all mushrooms. This mushroom has a greenish-gray cap, white gills, and a large white sac at the bottom of its stem. Death Caps grow throughout California during the rainy months, from fall to early winter.</li>
                <li><strong>Poison Hemlock:</strong> Poison hemlock is a member of the carrot family and has a long taproot. It can be confused with other plants, so it's important to be careful. </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="hazard-fish" class="hazard-section">
            <h2>Common Hazardous Fish</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>California Scorpionfish:</strong> Also known as Sculpin, these fish have needles in their spines that release a poison. While this poison is not the deadliest, it does cause immense pain.</li>
                <li><strong>Stingrays:</strong>Stingrays exist in shallow waters where they feed on shellfish and crustaceans in the sand and bury themselves to hide from predators. They have a sharp barb on their tail for defense, which flips up and can pierce the skin of the ankle or foot leaving a puncture wound.</li>
                <li><strong>Cyanobacteria:</strong> Also is known as Blue-Green Algae and is most dangerous during an algae bloom. When people are exposed to cyanobacterial toxins in freshwater, adverse health effects may range from a mild skin rash to serious illness or in rare circumstances, death.</li>
                <li><strong>Toxic Chemicals:</strong> Some freshwater fish in northern California have dangerously high levels of toxic chemicals, such as PFAS and PFOS. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment recommends following fish consumption advisories for the Feather and San Joaquin rivers.</li>
                <li><strong>Contaminated Fish:</strong> Fish in California can be contaminated by either chemicals and parasites. </li>
            </ul>

        <section id="hazard-animals" class="hazard-section">
            <h2>Common Hazardous Animals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Southern Pacific Rattlesnake:</strong> Also known as the black diamond rattlesnake, this pit viper is found in southwestern California and Baja California, Mexico. It's one of the largest rattlesnakes and its venom is highly toxic to humans</li>
                <li><strong>Black Widow:</strong> Bites can cause severe pain, muscle cramps, nausea, and sometimes temporary paralysis. However, fatalities are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than 1%. Black widow bites affect the nervous system and produce a potent neurotoxin protein.</li>
                <li><strong>Brown Recluse:</strong> Bites can cause skin damage, severe itching, fever, vomiting, and muscle pain. While most bites aren't serious, they can be more severe if the spider injects a lot of venom. Deaths are rare, but can occur in the young, elderly, or those who are sensitive to the venom.</li>
                <li><strong>Arizona Bark Scorpion:</strong> The Arizona bark scorpion has the most toxic sting in the U.S. The venom can cause severe pain and swelling at the sting site, numbness, frothing at the mouth, breathing problems, muscle twitching, and convulsions.</li>
                <li><strong>Mountain Lion:</strong> They are elusive, secretive animals rarely seen in the wild. Although their usual prey is deer and other wildlife, it is possible, although rare, for them to perceive humans as prey.</li>
                <li><strong>Coyote:</strong> Coyotes are adaptable and can live in most areas of California, except for the centers of major cities. It is also susceptible to diseases like rabies. </li>
                <li><strong>Black Bear:</strong> As the last bear species to still live in California, these large mammals are attracted to human food and trash, and can be a threat if they feel threatened. </li>
            </ul>
